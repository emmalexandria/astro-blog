## Conclusion

Putting my unhinged rant aside here, I hope you can see what I'm attempting to do. I think this is a genuinely intuitive way for people to make the transition to Vim. What I like about this approach is that it teaches you not only Vim motions but also something a lot closer to the Vim workflow. I have personally experienced that when switching to Vim, I feel 'trapped' within files. The inability to quickly mouse out and click on another is difficult somehow, and it makes programming not very enjoyable.

I think that this approach to transitioning to Vim really does bridge a gap with switching to Vim that isn't often acknowledged, which is that you work very differently. It really can feel suffocating until you're skilled enough that it becomes freeing. Introducing these changes one by one and giving them time to settle could make the process of switching to Vim far less uncomfortable.

Anyway, this isn't a learning path for me. I'm just genuinely stuck on VS Code because I'm too stubborn to learn how to work in terminal on Windows (because I know it'll suck). Send help and/or an NVMe boot drive for me to use for dual booting.
